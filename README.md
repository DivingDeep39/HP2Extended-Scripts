# HP2UScriptDecompile
Working decompiles of the obfuscated UScript in HP2

Requires Metallicafan212's engine to recompile these.

## Compiling yourself
To compile yourself, download the repo and add these folders to your game directiory (above System).
Then, go into default.ini in System and make sure that each package here is in the EditPackages list in [Editor.EditorEngine]

All you have to do is run ucc make in the system directory now.
