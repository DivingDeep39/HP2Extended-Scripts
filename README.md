# HP2UScriptDecompile
Working decompiles of the obfuscated UScript in HP2

Requires Metallicafan212's engine to recompile these.

### WARNING
This is the pre-alpha widescreen mod branch, things are broken here and it's a mess.
A new version is going to be worked on that will be a complete remake of the stock menus.

## Compiling yourself
To compile yourself, download the repo and add these folders to your game directiory (above System).
Then, go into default.ini in System and make sure that each package here is in the EditPackages list in [Editor.EditorEngine]

All you have to do is run ucc make in the system directory now.
